= easy_format

  easy_format is a Ruby on Rails plugin that formats and escapes
  database text for HTML views. The result looks a lot like text in
  Gmail: line breaks are converted and HTTP links are linked up.
  
  It will not support tags like BBCode; it just formats plain text.

== Installation

  gem install ryanlowe-easy_format --source http://gems.github.com/

== Usage

  <%= EasyFormat.format(@post.body) %>
  
  Note: HTML brackets are escaped by format() so
  you do not need to use h() as well.
