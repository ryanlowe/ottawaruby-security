= audit_mass_assignment plugin for Ruby on Rails

  The audit_mass_assignment Ruby on Rails plugin contains a rake task that
  checks the models in your project for the attr_accessible whitelist approach
  for protecting against "mass assignment" exploits.  It does not check for
  use of attr_protected.

== Installation

  gem install ryanlowe-audit_mass_assignment --source http://gems.github.com/

== Usage

  $ rake audit:mass_assignment

== Notes

  If you want to protect ALL attributes in your model use:
  
    attr_accessible nil

  Why are "mass assignment" exploits a danger to Rails applications? See these links:
